%By definition a confusion matrix C is such that C[i, j] is equal to the number of observations known to be in group i but predicted to be in group j.

%Thus in binary classification, the count of true negatives is C[0,0], false negatives is C[1,0], true positives is C[1,1] and false positives is C[0,1].

% CM = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)

% TN = CM[0][0]
% FN = CM[1][0]
% TP = CM[1][1]
% FP = CM[0][1]

\section{Things to do}
% Custom activation function
% https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43915482/how-do-you-create-a-custom-activation-function-with-keras
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Checkpoint and save best weights instead of just running for $512$ epochs. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42666046/loading-a-trained-keras-model-and-continue-training}
\item{Also, checkpoint and restart}
\item{}
\item{Use prior knowledge to improve performance. e.g. if we know that radius can lie between 1 pixel and 3 pixels, perhaps we can use that information to improve performance. Similarly if we know that stiffness can lie between specifed ranges, then use that knowledge to constrain NN output}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}
From \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff}. The critical point is  that expectations are taken over the training set. And that $f$
  is deterministic (i.e. independent of D), (which I don't get because what does into $f$ is $x$ which is part of the D).  After that, the proof is easy. \\
But the proof in Stanley Chan's IPDS pg 431-433 is very nice.

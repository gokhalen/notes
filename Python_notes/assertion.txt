assert (len(select) == len(types)),  'Length of select is not equal to length of types'

Do not use

assert (len(select) == len(types),  'Length of select is not equal to length of types')

It will treat (len(select) == len(types),  'Length of select is not equal to length of types') as a tuple, which being non empty 
will always evaluate to True

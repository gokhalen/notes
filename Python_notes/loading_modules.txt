Each module loads and executes only once. Note: Repeated imports just return a reference to the previously loaded module.

A common confusion arises if you repeat an import statement after changing the source code for a module. 
Because of the module cache sys.modules, repeated imports always return the previously loaded module–even if a change was made. 
The safest way to load modified code into Python is to quit and restart the interpreter.

Spyder and other IDEs seem to reload modules if the files have changed. Python on the command line requires:

import importlib
importlib.reload(test_modules)

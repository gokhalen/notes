\section{Traction notes}
\subsection{My misconception}
Let us assume that the boundary can be divided as follows. $\Gamma=\Gamma_h\cup\Gamma_q$ and that all three displacement degrees of freedom are specified on $\Gamma_q$ and all three traction components are specified on $\Gamma_h$. This makes the notation simpler. The traction contribution to the rhs vector resulting from $(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{h})_{\Gamma_h}$
\beq
(N_A\mathbf{e}_{i},\mathbf{h})_{\Gamma_h}
\eeq
My mistake was that it seemed that we were assembling the vector $\mathbf{h}$ into the location $(A,i)$. That is not so, due to the defition of the innerproduct $(\cdot,\cdot)_{\Gamma_h}$ which maps a pair of vectors to a real number. The simplification is
\beq
(N_A\mathbf{e}_{i},\mathbf{h})_{\Gamma_h} = \int_{\Gamma_h} N_{A}\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{h}\,d\Gamma_{h} = \int_{\Gamma_h}N_Ah_id\Gamma_{h}
\eeq
Note $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ is a vector with zeros everywhere except at its $i^{th}$ component, which is $1$.
\subsection{Traction elements not aligned with the co-ordinate axes}
If traction elements are not aligned with the coordinate axes, performing integration over them is non-trivial. Some references are:\\

Integrating over a boundary of a 3D trilinear element: we want to integrate over an arbitrary plane (which is not parallel to XY, XZ, or YZ planes) in 3D, we can regard x,y as independent variables and treat z=f(x,y). f depends on the equation of the plane.  Find the angle theta between the plane and the XY plane. Change a surface element of the plane dS=cos(theta)dxdy or something similar. Now this problem reduces to a double integration problem.
